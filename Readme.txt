Long Professional CV

Original description:
This curriculum vitae template is clearly structured with bold centered category names for each section. The descriptions of tasks for each job are in bullet points. This template is conducive to longer CVs since there is no aesthetic limit to how much information can be placed in each section. Would suit a professional in the mid- to late-stage of their career.

Important note: The file res.cls is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom class for structuring the document.
